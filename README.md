### Drew Day, PhD ðŸ“Š

I'm an environmental epidemiologist at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, and I both develop and apply statistical methods to investigate the early life determinants of childhood chronic disease.

### Research Interests
 - Omics prediction of chronic disease: Using omics data to predict chronic disease patterns to discover shared mechanisms
 - Multi-outcome health profiles: Using phenotypes of disease outcome co-occurrence to indentify risks and mechansims shared between seemingly unrelated diseases
 - Mixture exposures: Advancing mixture exposure modelling to understand the combined health impact of common environmental factors
 - Developmental origins of disease: exploring associations between early life chemical and other stressor exposures and later life chronic disease

### Methods Development/Teaching
 - R package [wqspt](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wqspt/index.html): Using a novel permutation test method to improve the statistical properties of the weighted quantile sum regression, which determines the additive combined association of multiple exposures with a single outcome.
 - R package [impgrplasso](https://www.github.com/drewdstat/impgrplasso):
